# PocketDoc — Claude Instructions

## Sync command

When Nick says **"sync my health website"** or **"sync the site"**:

1. Read the Obsidian master note:
   `/Users/nicolascapra/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/iCloud Vault/🏥 Health/Resources/Nicks Health Resource Website.md`

2. Read `index.html`

3. For each SYNC anchor pair in index.html (format: `<!-- SYNC:key -->...<!-- /SYNC:key -->`), find the corresponding section in the Obsidian note and compare the text content.

4. Update only the sections where the content has changed. Replace the content between the anchor comments — preserve the anchor comments themselves and all surrounding HTML.

5. When a product's `[link: ...]` line in Obsidian has a real URL (not "placeholder"), also update the `href` on the wrapping `<a>` tag for that product card.

6. `git add index.html`, commit with a message listing what changed, `git push`.

7. Report back: which sections were updated, what changed.

## Notes

- The `[link: ...]` and `[meta]` lines in Obsidian are not rendered as copy — they're metadata only.
- Lab table structure (row numbers, lab names, LabCorp codes, frequency badges, ICD-10 codes) is NOT synced — only the "Why it matters" description text inside each `<td>` is synced via the `lab-m-*` and `lab-f-*` keys above.
- The Lab Interpreter section is not synced — it's code-driven.
- Do not reformat or restructure HTML outside the SYNC anchor pairs.
- For `lab-*` keys: the SYNC anchor is inline inside the `<td>`, e.g. `<td><!-- SYNC:lab-m-cmp -->text<!-- /SYNC:lab-m-cmp --></td>`. Replace only the text between the anchors.
